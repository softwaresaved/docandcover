## Novelty, creativity, coolness and/or usefulness

### Problem

When launching or reviewing new research software, it is often difficult to determine if all aspects of your developer code has been fully documented, whether that is in-code commenting or discrete developer documentation. Moreover, there as yet no straightforward metric for software documentation within the Software Assessment Framework, which would improve both is usability and authority.

### Solution

*Doc and Cover* provides a simple solution! It scans your software source code and documentation, identifying the functions, parameters and returns contained therein. It then scans through your in-code comments as external documentation, identifying information about those elements, providing you a print out those functions for which documentation was found, and awarding you a score based on the level (length) of documentation found.

### Novelty

Although similar to Code Coverage, *Doc and Cover* provides a similar (and heretofore unavailable) function for your software documentation

### Wider Applicability

The aim of the *Doc and Cover* is to roll it out as part of the Software Assessment Framework as a means of establishing a community of best practice.

## Implementation and infrastructure  

### Use of Best Practice

*Doc and Cover* was developed by all three team members, drawing on their various experiences of software development to ensure all aspects of development (workflow, synchronised coding, licensing, publication) were established at the start of the project, ensuring that all team members were fully aware of the overall architecture of the programme, the data structures within it, and the final product for today, and that they were all fully happy with these decisions.
 
#### Repository

*Doc and Cover* is available in an open Github repository under the Software Sustainability Institute's main repository

#### Documentation

Preliminary user documentation has been included as a Readme.md in the top-level of the repository

#### Services and Infrastructure

*Doc and Cover* does not rely on significant external infrastructure, but has been built within an open Git Repository to ensure transparity and ease of re-use and development

### Building on existing work

*Doc and Cover* does not build upon an existing code, and was developed on the evening of the 28th and 29th of March.
  
## Demo and presentation

### Data

The *Doc and Cover* demonstration will be used on the code of another project team, which we considered to be code developed with the intention of best practice (likely users in the future) but with limited time for full documentation checking.

### The Big 'Why'

We feel that *Doc and Cover* provides a simple and much needed workflow checkpoint to help further the aims of the Institute and our shared commitment to developing sustainable research software.

## Future potential

### Future endeavours

The project team are all keen to continue developing the code, providing additional parsers for different languages and user documentation styles. 

### Future usefulness

As the software is itself language-indifferent, it can be updated in the future as new standards and styles of coding and documentation develop. As it aims to become part of the Software Assessment Framework, it aims to be an important part of ongoing community development

## Team work

Because of our different past experiences, and our generally incomplete knowledge of Python, made the environment extremely collegial and a true 'flat' hierarchy. Everyone was able to contribute their understanding of python, regex and general programming logic to every other person's code. Moreover, because of the thoughtful planning in the first hour of the day, we were able to work concurrently for most of the morning, and then work together in the afternoon to knit together our various workflow portions.
