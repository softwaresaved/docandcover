Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question as a [new issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/docandcover/issues/new).
